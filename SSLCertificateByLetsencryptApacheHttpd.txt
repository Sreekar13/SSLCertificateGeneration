#This is to create a SSL certificate and host a webpage of a server

Steps are as follows:-

SSH into that target machine which acts as a web server of the DNS

Become a root user as you would be supposed to execute a few commands which require sudo privileges    **********BE SURE YOU KNOW CONS OF USING ROOT PRIVILEGES**********

//su -

We use httpd daemon to host our webpage and ssl_mode package. To install,

//yum install -y httpd mod_ssl

We have to start the web server now to access the webpage that would be hosted on httpd

//systemctl start httpd
To start the service in case rebooted
//systemctl enable httpd

Check the status of the httpd
//systemctl is-active httpd

It’s time to display something in the browser, when accessed this server’s 8080 or 443 port

//cat “<html><head>Secure Sockets Layer connection establishment</head><body><h1>This is the page. Welcome to the secured connection webpage</h1></body></html>”  > /var/www/html/index.html

Check if the service has the document root pointing to /var/www/html/index.html in /etc/httpd/conf/httpdd.conf file 

Then we have to create SSL certificate, we need some packages from epel repository

//yum install -y epel-release

//yum install -y certbot

//yum install -y python2-apache-certbot

//certbot  - - apache -d  <dns of the server>

Key in the necessary information and then choose either easy or secure method of access. (I prefer secure coz even http connection is redirected to https)

To check the cert files generated by certbot

//find /etc/letsencrypt/live

Check if the cert files are pointed correctly in /etc/httpd/conf/httpdd.conf file and then try accessing https://<name of the dns>, it would give you a valid certificate :)
